Investigation of terrorism’s effects through public attitudes towards politics is a necessity so that to detect the social reaction to such thought-provoking disasters. Starting from Amélie Godefroidt’s pioneering study (Godefroidt, 2023), this paper takes further her insights and tries to bring in more deterministic factors that may work towards shaping the public opinion related to terrorism. However, both Mia and I agree on the implications of ethic, limitations and future hopeful prospects.

## Findings

Our research proves to be only an addition to Godefroidt's theory, however our findings, obviously, point to direct effects of the terrorist acts on citizens' political attitudes. One striking feature here is that of hatred for the out-group members and political conservatism of the prublic following such catastrophies. This affirms that terror creates a feeling of insecurity and a need for JWen safety which is a reason for a more cautious political position. Also, our results put the emphasis on the way terrorism is shaped in influence of terrorism. For instance, ideological violence perpetrated in the name of Islam seems to have a tremendous amplifying impact and induces much stronger responses than violence underpinned by other ideologies. This in accord with former studies focusing on the specific consequences of Islamist extremism on Western countries that associate the latter with the idea of cultural and national identity. Thus it is considered as a threat to the civic and national identity.

## Ethical Implications and Bias

Studying terrorism from the ethical dimension proves it cannot be underestimated. Being the such consequence causing sensitive part of the topic, and its role for evoking and spreading fear and xenophobia, the scientists should handle it with specific techniques. An application of rigorous meta-analysis methodology assures reliable inquiry, lack of harm, and the polysemic exploration of the problem of the correlation between terrorism and political attitudes. Nevertheless, it should be acknowledged that the existence of bias is one of the key challenges that could be connected with the initial studies in our analysis. For an example, each victim is likely to be bombarded over the media and end up being Islamist terrorism which is highly visible in media coverage and public discourse. Albeit, while one dimension of ideological violence may not be accurately portrayed, other forms such as far-right extremism or eco-terrorism may not be sufficiently emphasized. Such dyads are likely to find themselves in a arena in which distorted views will dominate and the situation will be perceived far from its true scale.

## Limitations

In addition to the implemented design in order to realize the highest accuracy of a meta-analysis, we faced several limitations, limiting the range and generality of our findings. Our approach which heavily depends on a secondary data is unable to control for all the conﬂounding variables that may be influential, such as socio-economic class or psychological characteristics of the individual. Furthermore, the use of published sources may leave room for the ‘file drawer’ effect wherein studies with positive results are likely to be published while studies with no significant effect are simply left in the drawer.

## Future Research

In order to rectify these limitations as well as bring clarity into how terrorism changes the political views of a society, there should be an all round approach for the research. At first, applying primary data collection methods, e.g. surveys or interviews, is a good idea since it can bring you concrete views of how people behave in terrible situations. This will ultimately allow the scientists to enable the research system to explore intricacies and contextual factors which may not be available in the datasets that currently exist. In addition, the issue must be viewed from a wider angle, not being limited only to a single terrorist ideology but covering the broad spectrum of ideologies. Our primary target however revolves around Islamist terrorism alone, yet the other extreme movements for instance, right- or left-wing extremism also deserve attention. It is critical for the success of counterterrorism policies and social unity that the concerns are comprehensively analyzed re the ideologies that shape the views of the mass public and the political attitudes. Moreover, as terrorism is seen in many contexts other than the Western world, exploring this issue will contribute to a deeper global comprehension. Terrorism being a very much issues based on the diversity of cultures, societies and their political emotions is not the same across the world. Years long longitudinal studies which track individuals perceptions overtime will provide a wealth of information to the long term effects of terrorism, to name some of these as a mention, radicalization, resilience and social transformation.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the work offer a new insight into what the influence of terrorism on political attitudes was in the past. Our research replicates Godefroidt's study while trying to expand on it. This is to drive home the fact that terrorists are always a constant factor in the society with their potentially dangerous ideologies. Furthermore, there is the endless ethical and biases topic which is very sensitive and proposing lanes for future research for the same problem is well thought out.

In the 21st century, terrorism has become a pivotal concern in global politics, influencing international relations and societal norms across the world. The impact of terrorism necessitates a comprehensive analysis, particularly concerning its influence on public attitudes towards democracy, outgroup hostility, political conservatism, and national unity. Despite the prevalence of terrorist incidents and their apparent effects on society, there remains a critical gap in understanding how these events shape public opinion across different contexts.

This paper builds upon the foundation work of *Amélie Godefroidt* in 2022, published in American Journal of Political Science [@Godefroidt2023] which highlighted the significant impact of terrorism on public attitudes. Our study aims to replicate and extend Godefroidt's analysis by examining effects of various forms of terrorism on public sentiment from domestic incidents to global terror campaigns. We use a meta-analytical approach, integrating findings from a broad spectrum of research to provide an overview of terrorism's impact on public opinion.

This paper delves into the complex dynamics of terrorism's influence on public political opinion. It extends the discourse beyond conventional analysis to explore how various expressions of terrorism—ranging from domestic to international incidents—affect public attitudes, with a particular focus on outgroup hostility, political conservatism, and rally-'round-the-flag phenomena. Despite a growing body of research in this field, there remains a significant gap in understanding the holistic and nuanced effects of different forms of terrorism across diverse sociopolitical contexts. To address this gap, we systematically analyze and integrate findings from prior research, employing a variety of methodological approaches to offer a comprehensive overview of terrorism's impact on public sentiment. Despite the extensive research in this area, a gap persists in understanding the diverse sociopolitical landscapes. To address this gap, we analyze and integrate findings from prior research, to provide a comprehensive overview of terrorism's impact on public sentiment.

Our findings reveal that terrorism significantly influences public opinion, catalyzing a shift towards outgroup hostility and political conservatism, with varying effects on national unity. These shifts are contingent upon the nature of the terrorist threat and the specific sociopolitical context, underscoring the importance of contextual factors in public responses to terrorism. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on terrorism's implications for democratic societies, offering empirical evidence of its subtle yet profound impact on public political attitudes. By elucidating the conditions under which terrorism most significantly affects public sentiment, this study aims to inform both policymakers and scholars, guiding the development of strategies to enhance democratic resilience in the face of terrorism.

The paper is structured as follows: it begins with an overview of the methodological framework guiding our analysis in [Data section](#sec-data), followed by a presentation of our findings in [Results section](#sec-data-results). We then discuss these in the context of their broader implications for democracy and conclude with recommendations for future research and policy considerations in [Discussion section](#sec-data).
